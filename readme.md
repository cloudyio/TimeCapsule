Time capsule is a easy to use website that uses your local storage to view a note at a further day, on the day when the website is visited on that day or further it will allow you to view your note and create a new one

## Features
- Runs client sided, your notes wont be sent to a server
- Very easy to use and only 2 boxes to be filled
- Good looking ui
- Reusable

## How to cheat
If you REALLY want to you can view your note inside of your local storage, you can also change the date if you set that wrong

## How to host
- I reccomend you use a PaaS like vercel or self host your own one, you can run `npm run build` and run it like that if you absolutley have to
- If you want to change stuff you can view it live with `npm run dev`

Built with sveltekit and daisyui
